//// structure , union, typedef, enum

//enums
- enum color{
RED, BLUE, GREEN, WHITE
};
- makes code readable
- 
//typedef
- is used to define new type, or alias to exiisting type 
 unsigned short int var;
 typedef unsigned short int u_int16; ( from now onwards u_init16 can be used)
 u_int16 var2; // correct ways

//structure
-can combine different datatypes(heterogenious data types) in a single entity -ex: store student record
-struct compound_datapacket {
		int id;
		char* name;
		char* data;
	};

//linked list
- linked list (evry node will have data point and pointer to next node)
 - one ptr points to head and anothe pointer tail of linked list
- last node points to NULL

//unions
- size of word ( 8bit/32bit/64bit depending on the which bit machine)
- memebers of the union shares memory
- memory - is largest size of data  memory
